Below are the image statistics of both versions of the micah.jpg image...

Normal with histogramEQ:
rMin: 0, rMax: 1, rMean: 0.221687, rStdDev: 0.312104
gMin: 0.127761, gMax: 0.999999, gMean: 0.234287, gStdDev: 0.311991
bMin: 0.00214267, bMax: 1, bMean: 0.234691, bStdDev: 0.309815

With 1.8 Gamma and histogramEQ:
rMin: 0.0567173, rMax: 1, rMean: 0.21994, rStdDev: 0.311221
gMin: 0.114469, gMax: 1, gMean: 0.229823, gStdDev: 0.311021
bMin: 0.148584, bMax: 1, bMean: 0.235417, bStdDev: 0.308359

As you can see, there are clearly some differences in the values. However, the discrepancies are not nearly as large as I imagined.
This translates to the visual images themselves even more. The differences in the 2 images that I produced with these commands are
as close to undetectable as they can be without completely getting past me. Overall, I would say that the image with the gamma applied
is ever-so-slightly brighter than the normal image with only histogramEQ applied. The differences are really only noticeable in
certain spots of the image such as the shadow in the skin on Micah's neck and some of the texture of his hair. So I would say that
the images do not differ much at all. For a quantitative comparison, I would look at the differences of all the values above, but
especially the mean values:

rMeanNormal - rMeanGamma = 0.221687 - 0.21994 = 0.001747
gMeanNormal - gMeanGamma = 0.234287 - 0.229823 = 0.004464
bMeanNormal - bMeanGamma = 0.234691 - 0.235417 = -0.000726

These are fairly minute differences in the mean values of both versions of the image.
