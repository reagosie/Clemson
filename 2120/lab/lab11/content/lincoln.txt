From whence shall we expect the approach of danger?
Shall some transatlantic giant step the earth and crush us at a blow? Never!
All the armies of Europe and Asia could not, by force, take a drink from the Ohio River
or set a track on the Blue Ridge in the trial of a thousand years.
If destruction be our lot, we ourselves must be its author and finisher.
As a nation of free men, we will live forever or die by suicide.
