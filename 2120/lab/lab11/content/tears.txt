You should know that you don't kick if you don't have to
All's fair in love and war, I know, don't get me wrong
But if you listen to your heart it may mislead you
Lord I should know, I've felt lost for so long

You had me go from what I thought was sliding carefully
To seriously slipping out of control

But I'm gonna have to learn that this love will never be convenient
I'm gonna have to learn that this love will never be convenient
It's not like a movie when we kiss; there'll never be no music when we kiss
And I'm gonna have to learn that this love will never be convenient, convenient, oh, convenient

I hear her whisper, "All I want is to want nothing."
The room is dark and I'm pretty sure she thinks I'm asleep
She says, "It just don't make no sense. Why can't it work out in my head?
Why I can't be happy when there's definitely reasons I should be."

She says that I, for one, will not be held responsible for someone else, I gotta go

I'm gonna have to learn that this love will never be convenient
And I'm gonna have to learn that this love will never be convenient, convenient, oh, convenient

Let's talk about how it felt on my shoulders as it came pouring out my ears
Let's talk about the face of our love and how it might look with the addition of tattooed tears
Let's talk about the torn up skin on my fingers right where it meets my fingernails
Let's talk about what you call sliding carefully is seriously slipping out of control

I'm gonna have to learn that this love will never be convenient
I'm gonna have to learn that this love will never be convenient
It's not like a movie when we kiss, there'll never be no music when we kiss
And I'm gonna have to learn that this love will never be convenient, convenient, oh, convenient
