I am aware that many object to the severity of my language;
but is there not cause for severity?
I will be as harsh as truth, and as uncompromising as justice.
On this subject, I do not wish to think, or speak, or write, with moderation.
No! No! Tell a man whose house is on fire to give a moderate alarm;
tell him to moderately rescue his wife from the hands of the ravisher;
tell the mother to gradually extricate her babe from the fire into which it has fallen;
but urge me not to use moderation in a cause like the present.
I am in earnest. I will not equivocate. I will not excuse.
I will not retreat a single inch and I will be heard.
The apathy of the people is enough to make every statue leap from its pedestal,
and to hasten the resurrection of the dead.
