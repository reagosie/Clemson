I've been told I got a problem with the hours that I keep
See, I work until the sunrise and at noon I'm still asleep
So if you feel alone then you can call my phone at night
My insomnia's your blessing, there's no need for stressing
If you have a question, I, I, I

[Chorus]
I'm probably up
I'm probably up
I'm probably up
Ooh, I'm probably up

[Verse 2]
Now I know it ain't the normal, and I don't care if people say
(He's lazy, so lazy)
Oh I wrote this song while they were sleeping, now I'm done working for the day
(It's crazy, ooh baby)
So if you're looking out your window, and scared to see there ain't no light
Just know that I'll be up until the morning
With SNL and Conan
Screw the melatonin, I, I, I

[Chorus]
I'm probably up (ooh)
I'm probably up (ooh)
I'm probably up (ooh)
Ooh, I'm probably up

[Bridge]
I, I, I, I
I, I, I, I
I, I, I, I
I, I, I, I

[Refrain]
I'm probably up (ooh)
Oh, I'm probably up (ooh)
Oh baby, baby, baby, probably up (ooh)
Baby, oh, I'm probably up
Know that any time at all I'm probably up
I'm probably up
Don't you know that you can call
I'm probably up
Oh, I'm probably up
