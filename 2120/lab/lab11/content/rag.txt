Rag and bone!
Rag and bone!
Rag and bone!
Rag and bone!
Meg, look at this place.
What? Woo...
Well, this place is like a mansion!
It's like a mansion, look at all this stuff!
I dunno...
Look, I see something over there
Woo...
Man...
Well, could you ever sell it rag and bone?
Bring out your junk and we'll give it a home
A broken trumpet or a telephone
Ah, come on, ah, come on, ah, come on
Come on and give it to me
Yeah
Ah, come on, ah, come on, ah, come on
Come on and give it to me
Oh, rag and bone
Rag and bone
Ah, come on, ah, come on, ah, come on
Come on and give it to me
Oh, looking pretty
Your pretty little rags and bones
Well, man, look at all this, you don't want it?
You sure you don't want it, man? I could use... take it.
It's just things you don't want - I can use 'em; Meg can use 'em;
We can do something with 'em; we'll make something out of 'em,
Make some money out of 'em at least.
Mmm-hmm, this fits me perfect.
Give it to me.
Hey, if you ain't gonna use it, just give it to us.
We'll give it a home.
Well, have they got something shiny for me?
Anybody got a Christmas tree?
Can you party with a toilet seat?
Ah, jump up, ah, jump up, ah, jump up
Come on and give it to me
Rag and bone
We wanna get it, granny, while it's hot
You think it's trash, granny, but it's not
Oh, we'll be taking whatever you got
Ah, give up, ah, give up, ah, give up
Come on and give it to me
Woo!
Oh, looking pretty
Your pretty little rags and bones
I saw some stuff in your yard; are you gonna give it to us?
Ah, Meg, don't be rude
Or not?
They might need it.
If you don't want it, we'll take it.
If you don't wanna give it to us, we'll keep walking by.
We'll keep going; we're not tired.
Got plenty of places to go, lots of homes we ain't been to yet
On the west side, the south-west side, Middle East, rich house, dog house, outhouse
Old folks' house, house for unwed mothers, halfway homes, catacombs, twilight zones.
Look at what techniques turn tables to gramophones.
So take a last lick of your ice-cream cone
And lock up what you still wanna own
But please be kind (take your time)
And don't rewind (it's fine)...
All of your pretty
Your pretty little rags and bones
Yeah, your pretty little rags and bones
Ah, jump up, ah, jump up, ah, jump up
Come on and give it to me
Oh, your pretty little rags and bones
Ah, come on, ah, come on, ah, come on
Come on and give it to us!
Yeah
Yeah, yeah
Oh yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
