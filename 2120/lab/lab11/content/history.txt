NO MATTER HOW hard you try you will never be able to grasp just how tiny, how spatially
unassuming, is a proton. It is just way too small.
A proton is an infinitesimal part of an atom, which is itself of course an insubstantial thing.
Protons are so small that a little dib of ink like the dot on this i can hold something in the
region of 500,000,000,000 of them, rather more than the number of seconds contained in half
a million years. So protons are exceedingly microscopic, to say the very least.
Now imagine if you can (and of course you can't) shrinking one of those protons down to a
billionth of its normal size into a space so small that it would make a proton look enormous.
Now pack into that tiny, tiny space about an ounce of matter. Excellent. You are ready to start
a universe.
I'm assuming of course that you wish to build an inflationary universe. If you'd prefer
instead to build a more old-fashioned, standard Big Bang universe, you'll need additional
materials. In fact, you will need to gather up everything there is every last mote and particle of
matter between here and the edge of creation and squeeze it into a spot so infinitesimally
compact that it has no dimensions at all. It is known as a singularity.
In either case, get ready for a really big bang. Naturally, you will wish to retire to a safe
place to observe the spectacle. Unfortunately, there is nowhere to retire to because outside the
singularity there is no where. When the universe begins to expand, it won't be spreading out
to fill a larger emptiness. The only space that exists is the space it creates as it goes.
It is natural but wrong to visualize the singularity as a kind of pregnant dot hanging in a
dark, boundless void. But there is no space, no darkness. The singularity has no "around"
around it. There is no space for it to occupy, no place for it to be. We can't even ask how long
it has been there, whether it has just lately popped into being, like a good idea, or whether it
has been there forever, quietly awaiting the right moment. Time doesn't exist. There is no past
for it to emerge from.
And so, from nothing, our universe begins.
In a single blinding pulse, a moment of glory much too swift and expansive for any form of
words, the singularity assumes heavenly dimensions, space beyond conception. In the first
lively second (a second that many cosmologists will devote careers to shaving into ever-finer
wafers) is produced gravity and the other forces that govern physics. In less than a minute the
universe is a million billion miles across and growing fast. There is a lot of heat now, ten
billion degrees of it, enough to begin the nuclear reactions that create the lighter elements,
principally hydrogen and helium, with a dash (about one atom in a hundred million) of
lithium. In three minutes, 98 percent of all the matter there is or will ever be has been
produced. We have a universe. It is a place of the most wondrous and gratifying possibility,
and beautiful, too. And it was all done in about the time it takes to make a sandwich.
When this moment happened is a matter of some debate. Cosmologists have long argued
over whether the moment of creation was 10 billion years ago or twice that or something in
between. The consensus seems to be heading for a figure of about 13.7 billion years, but these
things are notoriously difficult to measure, as we shall see further on. All that can really be
said is that at some indeterminate point in the very distant past, for reasons unknown, there
came the moment known to science as t = 0. We were on our way.
There is of course a great deal we don't know, and much of what we think we know we
haven't known, or thought we've known, for long. Even the notion of the Big Bang is quite a
recent one. The idea had been kicking around since the 1920s, when Georges Lema√Ætre, a
Belgian priest-scholar, first tentatively proposed it, but it didn't really become an active
notion in cosmology until the mid-1960s when two young radio astronomers made an extraordinary
and inadvertent discovery.
Their names were Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson. In 1965, they were trying to make use
of a large communications antenna owned by Bell Laboratories at Holmdel, New Jersey, but
they were troubled by a persistent background noise, a steady, steamy hiss that made any
experimental work impossible. The noise was unrelenting and unfocused. It came from every
point in the sky, day and night, through every season. For a year the young astronomers did
everything they could think of to track down and eliminate the noise. They tested every
electrical system. They rebuilt instruments, checked circuits, wiggled wires, dusted plugs.
They climbed into the dish and placed duct tape over every seam and rivet. They climbed
back into the dish with brooms and scrubbing brushes and carefully swept it clean of what
they referred to in a later paper as "white dielectric material," or what is known more
commonly as bird shit. Nothing they tried worked.
Unknown to them, just thirty miles away at Princeton University, a team of scientists led by
Robert Dicke was working on how to find the very thing they were trying so diligently to get
rid of. The Princeton researchers were pursuing an idea that had been suggested in the 1940s
by the Russian-born astrophysicist George Gamow that if you looked deep enough into space
you should find some cosmic background radiation left over from the Big Bang. Gamow
calculated that by the time it crossed the vastness of the cosmos, the radiation would reach
Earth in the form of microwaves. In a more recent paper he had even suggested an instrument
that might do the job: the Bell antenna at Holmdel. Unfortunately, neither Penzias and
Wilson, nor any of the Princeton team, had read Gamow's paper.
The noise that Penzias and Wilson were hearing was, of course, the noise that Gamow had
postulated. They had found the edge of the universe, or at least the visible part of it, 90 billion
trillion miles away. They were "seeing" the first photons, the most ancient light in the
universe, though time and distance had converted them to microwaves, just as Gamow had
predicted. In his book The Inflationary Universe , Alan Guth provides an analogy that helps to
put this finding in perspective. If you think of peering into the depths of the universe as like
looking down from the hundredth floor of the Empire State Building (with the hundredth floor
representing now and street level representing the moment of the Big Bang), at the time of
Wilson and Penzias's discovery the most distant galaxies anyone had ever detected were on
about the sixtieth floor, and the most distant things, quasars, were on about the twentieth.
